                <p class="faq-text">
                    An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate
                    that establishes a secure, encrypted connection between a web
                    server and a web browser. When a website has an SSL certificate
                    installed, it means that all data exchanged between the server and
                    the browser is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access. This
                    helps to protect sensitive information, such as login credentials,
                    credit card details, and other personal information, from being
                    intercepted by malicious third parties. You can tell if a website
                    has an SSL certificate by looking for the padlock icon in the
                    browser address bar and the "https" prefix in the website URL.

                <span class="title-faq">What is Russian Trusted CA</span>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    It appears that some companies are currently experiencing
                    difficulties in obtaining SSL Certificates from Certification
                    Authorities. The Ministry of Communications has set up its own
                    "trusted" certification centre to issue certificates, but these
                    certificates are not considered secure by most browsers, except
                    for Russian ones.<br>
                    Since we do not know the conditions under which certificates are
                    created in the Russian CA, and they certainly do not meet the
                    standards for normal CAs, we cannot trust them. Maybe they are
                    doing well there, or maybe they are creating special additional
                    "private keys" for the other "authorities".

                <p class="faq-text">
                    Self-signed web certificates are created and signed by the website
                    owner instead of a trusted Certificate Authority, which can pose a
                    security risk as the site's identity cannot be verified. Attackers
                    can also create fake self-signed certificates to intercept and
                    potentially modify information transmitted between the user and
                    the website, known as a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
