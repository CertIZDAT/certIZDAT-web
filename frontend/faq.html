            <p class="faq-text">
              An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate
              that establishes a secure, encrypted connection between a web
              server and a web browser. When a website has an SSL certificate
              installed, it means that all data exchanged between the server and
              the browser are encrypted and secure from unauthorized access.
              This helps to protect sensitive information, such as login
              credentials, credit card details, and other personal information,
              from being intercepted by malicious third parties. You can tell if
              a website has an SSL certificate by looking for the padlock icon
              in the browser address bar and the "https" prefix in the website
              URL.

            <p class="faq-text">
              It appears that some companies are currently experiencing
              difficulties in obtaining SSL Certificates from Certification
              Authorities. The Ministry of Communications has set up its own
              "trusted" certification centre to issue certificates, but these
              certificates are not considered secure by most browsers, except
              for Russian ones.<br>
              Since we do not know the conditions under which certificates are
              created in the Russian CA, and they certainly do not meet the
              standards for normal CAs, we cannot trust them. Maybe they are
              doing well there, or maybe they are creating special additional
              "private keys" for the other "authorities".

            <span class="title-faq">What is self-signed certificates</span>
            <p class="faq-text">
              Self-signed web certificates are created and signed by the website
              owner instead of a trusted Certificate Authority, which can pose a
              security risk as the site's identity cannot be verified. Attackers
              can also create fake self-signed certificates to intercept and
              potentially modify information transmitted between the user and
              the website, known as a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
